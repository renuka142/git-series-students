1. What do you understand by repository, in context to git?

ANS: As far as i understand git repository is like a folder, which contains a collection
of files of various different versions of our project. We use a version control system
to create the versions and create a git repository to collect these versions.
We can import files from the repository into the local server for further modifications.
We can also add our repository online for other users to make updates on our repository.


2. How does git work? Share with us it's whole workflow in the most precise
way possible.

ANS: In my opinion, Git is like the master who is checking on our every move. Git always finds out the changes we made in our project.
talking about the workflow of git first we create a folder of our project.
Then make this folder as a git project using the init command. As soon as the folder changes to project git start to monitor each and every action made by us on this project. Now we start our project we add some files; we
delete some files; we modify some files and all these changes are captured by the git.
When we give command git status, it gives us the status of our project. To save our project we use the add command to add the changes to the repository and then save these changes to the repository by using the commit command.
So this is how git workflow works and manages our projects.
