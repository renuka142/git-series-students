## DETAILS OF TASK COMPLETED

# Task 1
# Aim of the task:
    Setting up Git and Github environment

# 1. What do you mean by Git and GitHub?

 Git is a distributed version control system. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in
2005 for Developers working on the Linux Kernel and is being maintained by a large
community across the world. Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository
with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network
access or a central server.
Github on the other hand is a Web User-Interface with a Cloud Hosting Service that
allows for the maintenance of Git Repositories on Cloud. Github provides a whole host
of services that are conducive of Project Management with Issue Tracking and deploying
the Application with CI/CD Pipelines.

# 2. Why GitHub is so popular and used in most of the projects?
 
following are some reasons why github is so popular:
1) GitHub is an open-source platform, and the community is really what fuels it.
There are millions of programmers and hobbyists that download, review, and evaluate each other's work.
2) Exposure and insight that you can get on GitHub are simply unmatched by any other platform.
And this goes the other way around, you can discover code written by others, learn from it,
and even use it for your own projects.
3) Versions control on GitHub works much like on MS Office or Google Drive
Having such a version history is a must when you collaborate with someone on the same project.
Especially when the number of contributors surpasses double digits.
4) Using GitHub eliminates the need for complex corporate security solutions.
The platforms protect all your data for you: protects code branches,verifies commit signing, controls access.

# 3. What is a version control system? How Git is a VCS?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking
and managing changes to software code. we can also say that version control system manages the
versions of our project/software.
Suppose we are working on an android app we launch the 1.0 version after some time we want some.
changes we start working on 1.1 like that we update our main version into different versions
so if we try to manage all the history of versions developed by us, it becomes very lengthy.
So here version control system came and did this for us. As Git also manages our projects we
Can say that git is also a version control system.  

# 4. What are the other platforms similar to GitHub?
Github alternatives are :

* Gitlab
* BitBucket
* SourceForge
* Launchpad
* Google Cloud Source Repositories

# 5. Why are you interested in learning of Git and Github?
 I want to work on some projects, learn developing skill, and see how real-world deal with projects.
For all this, the basic and main step is to learn what is Git and Github.
That's why i am interested in learning Git and Github.

# Task 2
# Aim of the task
Learn about Git repository and use of git for managing the project.

# 1. What do you understand by repository, in context to git?

 As far as i understand git repository is like a folder, which contains a collection
of files of various different versions of our project. We use a version control system
to create the versions and create a git repository to collect these versions.
We can import files from the repository into the local server for further modifications.
We can also add our repository online for other users to make updates on our repository.

 
# 2. How does git work? Share with us it's whole workflow in the most precise way possible.

 In my opinion, Git is like the master who is checking on our every move. Git always finds out the changes we made in our project.
talking about the workflow of git first we create a folder of our project.
Then make this folder as a git project using the init command. As soon as the folder changes to project git start to monitor each and every action made by us on this project. Now we start our project we add some files; we
delete some files; we modify some files and all these changes are captured by the git.
When we give command git status, it gives us the status of our project. To save our project we use the add command to add the changes to the repository and then save these changes to the repository by using the commit command.
So this is how git workflow works and manages our projects.

 
# 3. Link of the repository that you created and pushed your project in.

# Task 3

In Day 3 task of Git & Github series , i have done the following task :

Now you need to do the following things in order to complete this task as
completed.
1. Fork this repo Github Repo
2. Clone it.
3. Do the following changes with your master branch
a. Create a directory with your name
b. Add 2 txt files in that directory, one in which you add your
introduction and in second you can add the questions and
answers of Day 1 and Day 2 tasks.

c. Commit the changes you have done, after that push it to github.
d. Lastly, make a PR with the changes you have done.

Once you have done it, again do the following:
1. Create a new branch at your local.
2. Make some changes using that branch.
3. Commit the changes and push that newly created branch to github.
4. Once done, make a PR with this newly created branch.

=============================================================================================

# Task 4

# Aim of the Task
Learn about intermediate and advanced terminologies in Git for better Project
Management.

# Task to be Completed
• Fork and Clone this Repository
• Make a PR with by creating a new branch which should contain the
following changes: – Create a folder named Task 4 inside the directory
with which you made PR 3. – Add 2 Markdown files in that directory.
One in which you add your introduction and in second you can add the
questions and answers of Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 tasks. All the answers
and questions should be written in the Markdown Language. – Commit
the changes you have done. Push it to Github. – Make a PR with your
changes.
• After that, Merge the changes to the Master when your PR has been
accepted.
• Once done, Create an issue on the Repository which has been shared above.
• After that create a new branch from master and create a merge conflict.
• Take a screenshot of the Merge Conflict and add it to the issue you have
created as mentioned in the description of how it occurred.
• Resolve the merge conflicts and merge the branch to the Master.
• Once merged successfully take a screenshot and upload it to the issue you
have created.
• Mention how you resolved the merge conflicts.
